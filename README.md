# Community

Please be excellent to each other.  Our rules are meant to be simple, but moderating around them can be difficult.  This guide is being written to help surface our rules, clarify some positions and set precedence.

Instance rules:

## Moderation

Rule1:  You will not engage in any form of harassing, discriminatory, threatening or offensive speech or behavior including but not limited to race, gender identity and expression, national origin, religion, disability, marital status, age, sexual orientation, or other protected categories.

### Moderation Actions:

Person actively posts hate, racist comments or uses words intentionally to harm others - 0 tolerance. Account will be restricted

Person threatens anyone - 0 tolerance. Account will be restricted.

Person posts as satire about religion - No action taken. Please don't report these, just don't follow them and mute/keyword filter if you need to.

Fake accounts - We're generally taking a strong position against these if they're are acting in bad faith since we don't want to "poison the well".  Trust is important. If they are clearly marked as satire, they will be individually reviewed against the general rules of not causing harm or violating trademarks, registrations and other legal issues.

### User Actions:

You only see what you follow or what you go and look for. There is no algorithm here sending you any content. If you decide to view the local or federated feeds, be warned that there are MILLIONS of people who participate there.  You have the power of "mute" - not seeing anyones post and "blocking" not having that person be able to see your posts.  Use these to create the timeline(s) you want.  You can also use keyword filtering to block out entire keywords.  I get tired of seeing people RT to mastodon so I have a filter for "RT @" which means those are silenced.
