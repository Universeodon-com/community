# Community

Please be excellent to each other.  Our rules are meant to be simple, but moderating around them can be difficult.  This guide is being written to help surface our rules, clarify some positions and set precedence.

Instance rules:

Rule3: Have fun, be creative, be inquisitive. This is your social network.

Rule4: Clearly content warn 18+ content, food, drugs (legal or otherwise), slurs, ableist language, and other commonly tagged things. Keep it safe, we don't want to host your nudes.

Rule5: No promotion of gambling, anti-vaccination, self-harm, terrorism, illegal activities, Abuse/exploitation, or Violence. 

### Moderation Actions:

Person actively posts hate, racist comments or uses words intentionally to harm others - 0 tolerance. Account will be restricted

Person threatens anyone - 0 tolerance. Account will be restricted.

Person posts as satire about religion - No action taken. Please don't report these, just don't follow them and mute/keyword filter if you need to.

Any of these kinds of things will result in an immediate ban:

* Intentionally sending posts to someone that are designed to distress or insult them.
* Using posts, screenshots or out of context quotes to mock or make fun of someone else.
* Submitting false reports.
* Continuing to interact with someone after they have told you to stop.
* Threatening to harrass, threatening to dox, threatening to DDoS, or any other kind of threat.
* Sexual harassment or acting in a sexually predatory way.

Fake accounts - We're generally taking a strong position against these if they're are acting in bad faith since we don't want to "poison the well".  Trust is important. If they are clearly marked as satire, they will be individually reviewed against the general rules of not causing harm or violating trademarks, registrations and other legal issues.

#### Gambling?
No gambling, NFTs or Cryptocurrency allowed. These accounts/posts will be deleted or suspended on the spot. We do not have the means nor patience to patrol the validity of gaming, gambling and alternative currencies.

#### Ableist Language?
Yes, please don't use it. Google what this means and unlearn these habits. 

### User Actions:

You only see what you follow or what you go and look for. There is no algorithm here sending you any content. If you decide to view the local or federated feeds, be warned that there are MILLIONS of people who participate there.  You have the power of "mute" - not seeing anyones post and "blocking" not having that person be able to see your posts.  Use these to create the timeline(s) you want.  You can also use keyword filtering to block out entire keywords.  I get tired of seeing people RT to mastodon so I have a filter for "RT @" which means those are silenced.
